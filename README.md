this program allows you to add the course you want in RU, usually when lots of people trying to register for classes(for sophomore student or junior students), lots of popular class are always full, but sometimes when one or two people drops it, it will be reopened again. usually the period that the class is reopened is not long, because lot of people use rutgers course sniper(a software that can notice people by email if the class is reopened then people will add the course by themself, but they have to be quick), my software can add the course right away because it keeps adding the course all the time(if you start it it will run from morning to night) Rutgers university will suspended the student's webreg accout if they founded the student is using software to register for courses but my software is smarter, it is more closer to a human, what I did is set a sleep period in the program(that is a random number lower than 40 second), everytime you register for a class, the program will break of a while, then the system will not detect my program as a robot software.
